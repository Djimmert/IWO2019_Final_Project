# Introduction to Research Methods 2019-2020
# Final Project
## Usage
### ciara.sh
In the RUG karora environment:

./ciara.sh '2020/01/26' '2020/02/09' '2020/02/23' klimaat.txt output.txt

This is also the specific way it was used for the intended research.

### example.sh
In the RUG karora environment:

./example.sh klimaat.txt

This is also the specific way it was used to provide an example output for the intended research.

## Goal
This repository was made for the report on "Climate change mentions in Dutch Tweets under influence of storm Ciara". It is used to share code for assessment.

## Code
An example of the used code can be generated by running example.sh

## Data
For the research this code was originally meant for, the twitter2 corpus from the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen was used.
